### Introduction

One of the projects for our Exploring Computer Science class was to develop some kind of device that used LEDs, potentiometers, serial output, etc. This is my project.

I developed a traffic light with a red, yellow, and green LED as well as a potentiometer and two push buttons. The documentation is available here.

### Operation

* The system will begin with the red light turned on and in `STAY_ON` mode.

* The brightness of the LED can be adjusted using the potentiometer in any mode except `FADE` (since fading adjusts brightness automatically).

* The `Change Light` button will iterate between illuminating the red, yellow, and green LEDs.

* The `Change Mode` button will iterate between `BLINK` (turning on and off every half second), `FADE` (moving from lowest to highest brightness and back again), and `STAY_ON` (self explanatory).

* The brightness of the current light can be controlled using the potentiometer.
